Over the years, I have published a large number of tutorials in the areas of computer programming and 
	digital signal processing (DSP). As I have time available, I am converting the more significant of those tutorials into cnxml code and re-publishing them at

In the meantime, this is one of the pages in a book titled

that presents PDF versions of the original tutorials to make them readily available for Connexions users. 
When I have time available, I plan to update this tutorial and to re-publish it 
as a standard page at

This tutorial may contain internal links to other tutorials that I have 
written and published somewhere on the web. Those links may, or may not still be 
good. In any event, if you search

 for the 
tutorial by title or by topic, you will probably find a clean copy of the 
referenced tutorial at
